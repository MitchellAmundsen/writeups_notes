Common Registry Locations
	- What is the windows registry?

	The windows registry is a database that contains important informaton and settings for windows. The kernel, device drivers, services, account passwords, and UI all use the registry. 

	- What is it used for?

	windows references information from the registry thoughout operation.

	- How does malware use it for persistence?

	There are an array of places where code can be configured to launch automatically and remain realtively hidden away. 

		- HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\services

		Service controller loads the keys located here at various times. This is where .dll (dynamic link library) files are configured to be loaded by the host process (SvcHost.exe). A common place for RATs since windows has a ton of hosted Dlls and a good amount aren't in use. These become locations to autorun the RATs.

		- HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SVCHost

		RBAC is implemented here in windows. Services are grouped together and given privledges. Services that need access to the network are group together and called "netsvcs" as defined in the string found here. Attackers will iterate over the netsvcs services and test to see if a key already exists. If a key exists, then redirecting the .dll to their own key may break the original key's function and risk exposure, so attackers will look for an empty .dll.

		- HKEY_LOCAL_MAChINE\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\run

		Autoruns the listed .exe files on startup. 

WMI
	-What does it stand for?

	Windows Management Instrumentation = WMI

	-How is it used for administrative tasks?

	WMI is microsofts product for developing a standard technology for accessing management informaton in an enterprise environment. You can write scripts or applications to automate administrative tasks for PCs and servers remotely or locally. 

	-How could an attacker use it?

	Attackers can use WMI command line tool wmic.exe which extends WMI capabilities to shells and scripts. With WMI they can connect to remote systems, modify the registry, access event logs, and execute commands. This also leaves little evidence on the system.
