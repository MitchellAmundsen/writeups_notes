Common Registry Locations
	- What is the windows registry?

	The windows registry is a database that contains important informaton and settings for windows. The kernel, device drivers, services, account passwords, and UI all use the registry. 

	- What is it used for?

	windows references information from the registry thoughout operation.

	- How does malware use it for persistence?

	There are an array of places where code can be configured to launch automatically and remain realtively hidden away. 

		- HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\services

		Service controller loads the keys located here at various times. This is where .dll (dynamic link library) files are configured to be loaded by the host process (SvcHost.exe). A common place for RATs since windows has a ton of hosted Dlls and a good amount aren't in use. These become locations to autorun the RATs.

		- HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SVCHost

		RBAC is implemented here in windows. Services are grouped together and given privledges. Services that need access to the network are group together and called "netsvcs" as defined in the string found here. Attackers will iterate over the netsvcs services and test to see if a key already exists. If a key exists, then redirecting the .dll to their own key may break the original key's function and risk exposure, so attackers will look for an empty .dll.

		- HKEY_LOCAL_MAChINE\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\run

		Autoruns the listed .exe files on startup. 

WMI
	-What does it stand for?

	Windows Management Instrumentation = WMI

	-How is it used for administrative tasks?

	WMI is microsofts product for developing a standard technology for accessing management informaton in an enterprise environment. You can write scripts or applications to automate administrative tasks for PCs and servers remotely or locally. 

	-How could an attacker use it?

	Attackers can use WMI command line tool wmic.exe which extends WMI capabilities to shells and scripts. With WMI they can connect to remote systems, modify the registry, access event logs, and execute commands.This also leaves little evidence on the system. 

DLL Search Order Hijacking

	DLL (dynamic link library) files are collections of data and executable code that applications are other DLL files will use. They are essentially driver files for applications. Putting data in DLL files make it easier to update since you can just update the small file instead of the entire application. Programmers don't specify the path of every DLL file, so Microsoft made a DLL search order. 

	Directory of application
	Current directory
	System directory
	16-bit system directory
	Windows directory
	Directories in PATH variable

	It takes the first DLL file found in the search order. If application needs a file named "driver.dll" which is located in system directory, an attacker could place their own "driver.dll" file in the current directory. This DLL file could have executables and run malware or anything that the attacker may want.

DLL Side Loading

	DLL side loading is a less common variant of DLL search order hijacking. It uses Windows side-by-side (SxS or WinSxS), which helps manage conflicting duplicate DLL cersions by loading them on demand from a common directory. Side loading uses SxS to load malicious DLL from the SxS listing, located at the following registries.

	%TEMP%\RarSFX%\%ALLUSERS PROFILE%\SXS\
	or
	%TEMP%\RarSFX%\%ALLUSERS PROFILE%\WinSxS\

	WinSxS is a tool for developers to update or replace older DLL files with ease. WinSxS reduces the possibility of DLL version conflict, enables versions of COM or Windows assemblies to run simultaneuously, and updates assembly configuration on a global or per-application config basis after deployment. Because of this, there is little to no validation of the loaded DLL. It is essentially a DLL backdoor for developers that can be abused.

gh0st

	gh0st is a remote access trojan tool for windows. It can do the following:

	-take full control of the remote screen on the infected bot
	-provide real time as well as offline keystroke logging
	-provide live feed of webcam, microphone of infected host
	-take control of temore shutdown and reboot of host
	-disable infected computer remote pointer and keyboard input
	-enter into shell of remote infected host with full control
	-provide a list of all the active processes
	-clear all existing SSDT of all existing hooks

	The DLL is named SVCHOST.DLL. This is the server component of the gh0st toolkit and and checks in to the gh0st client application on startup. It is installed by the dropper program server.exe.

	A gh0st packet contains the following four fields:

	-a 5-byte header containing the characters Gh0st
	-a 4-byte integer that contains the size in bytes of the entire packet
	-a 4-byte integer that contains the size in bytes of the entire packet uncompressed
	-a variable-sized packet that contains the packet payload. The client sends small requests that contain commands, and the server repsponds to those commands with the requested data. 

	Detecting gh0st is trivial due to the 5-byte handshake, and a proper IDS(intrusion detection system) should be able to find a gh0st packet. Gh0st RATs are more complicated and harder to find nowadays. Some things to look for with include:

	Network Monitoring
		-outbound port 80 and 443 traffic to IP addresses and URLs in easter europe
		-outbound port 80 traffic connecting to remote server without sending user-agent information
		-create IDS signatures to detect the unique data content at the end of the dropper application
		-create IDS signatures to detect embedded executable files withing executable files

	Internal Port Scans
		Look for unexplained open TCP ports since gh0st needs to establish persistent connections. Routinely scan you internal network for suspicious open ports on systems/workstations.

	Monitor DNS Servers
		Logging DNS requests, since most modern malware uses dynamic DNS. One can configure their DNS server to log or alert on any request to dynamic DNS locations. Logging all DNS requests to Eastern Europe is also a good idea.

	Closely Monitor end-node services
		Use of rootkits by attackers has increased recently, which is designed to run in Ring 0 (ring network) alongside the kernel as a device driver. Most malware still runs in Ring 3 (user node) since driver programming is more difficult and less people can do it. Because of this, most malware is running as a service and hiding in plain sight. 

	Closely monitor end-node event logs
		If you are monitoring services on end nodes, than you should also be monitoring Windows event logs. Turn on auditing and enable logging for both successful and fail logins. Pay close attention to security event entries 528 and 540 (successful logs). Of these, look for logon types 3 (SMB shares) and 10 (RDP), then identify the logon account. Intruders will try to connect to another machine with elevated privlged accounts via SMB admin shares or using remote desktop. Monitor event logs for this activity. 

Poison Ivy
	
	Poison Ivy is a RAT that is created and controlled by a Poision Ivy management program. The management program has a GUI. Once ran, the backdoor copies itself to either the Windows folder or the system32 folder. Filename and location are decided by the creator of the backdoor. The registry is altered to for persistence. Poison Ivy give a large amount of control over the infected computer including:

	-files can be renamed, deleted, executed
	-files can be uploaded and downloaded to and from the system
	-registry can be edited
	-currently run process can be viewed and killed
	-services can be viewed and controlled
	-installed devices can be viewed and some devices can be disabled
	-the list of applications can be viewed and entries can be deleted or programs uninstalled
	-remote command shell
	-screen capture or webcam
	-access saved passwords and password hashes
