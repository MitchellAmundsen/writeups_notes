Common Registry Locations
	- What is the windows registry?

	The windows registry is a database that contains important information and settings for windows. The kernel, device drivers, services, account passwords, and UI all use the registry. 

	- What is it used for?

	Windows references information from the registry throughout operation.

	- How does malware use it for persistence?

	There are an array of places where code can be configured to launch automatically and remain relatively hidden away. 

		- HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\services

		Service controller loads the keys located here at various times. This is where .dll (dynamic link library) files are configured to be loaded by the host process (SvcHost.exe). A common place for RATs since windows has a ton of hosted Dlls and a good amount aren't in use. These become locations to auto run the RATs.

		- HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SVCHost

		RBAC is implemented here in windows. Services are grouped together and given privileges. Services that need access to the network are group together and called "netsvcs" as defined in the string found here. Attackers will iterate over the netsvcs services and test to see if a key already exists. If a key exists, then redirecting the .dll to their own key may break the original key's function and risk exposure, so attackers will look for an empty .dll.

		- HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\run

		Auto runs the listed .exe files on startup. 

WMI
	-What does it stand for?

	Windows Management Instrumentation = WMI

	-How is it used for administrative tasks?

	WMI is Microsoft product for developing a standard technology for accessing management information in an enterprise environment. You can write scripts or applications to automate administrative tasks for PCs and servers remotely or locally. 

	-How could an attacker use it?

	Attackers can use WMI command line tool wmic.exe which extends WMI capabilities to shells and scripts. With WMI they can connect to remote systems, modify the registry, access event logs, and execute commands. This also leaves little evidence on the system. 

DLL Search Order Hijacking

	DLL (dynamic link library) files are collections of data and executable code that applications are other DLL files will use. They are essentially driver files for applications. Putting data in DLL files make it easier to update since you can just update the small file instead of the entire application. Programmers don't specify the path of every DLL file, so Microsoft made a DLL search order. 

	Directory of application
	Current directory
	System directory
	16-bit system directory
	Windows directory
	Directories in PATH variable

	It takes the first DLL file found in the search order. If application needs a file named "driver.dll" which is located in system directory, an attacker could place their own "driver.dll" file in the current directory. This DLL file could have executables and run malware or anything that the attacker may want.

DLL Side Loading

	DLL side loading is a less common variant of DLL search order hijacking. It uses Windows side-by-side (SxS or WinSxS), which helps manage conflicting duplicate DLL versions by loading them on demand from a common directory. Side loading uses SxS to load malicious DLL from the SxS listing, located at the following registries.

	%TEMP%\RarSFX%\%ALLUSERS PROFILE%\SXS\
	or
	%TEMP%\RarSFX%\%ALLUSERS PROFILE%\WinSxS\

	WinSxS is a tool for developers to update or replace older DLL files with ease. WinSxS reduces the possibility of DLL version conflict, enables versions of COM or Windows assemblies to run simultaneously, and updates assembly configuration on a global or per-application config basis after deployment. Because of this, there is little to no validation of the loaded DLL. It is essentially a DLL backdoor for developers that can be abused.

gh0st

	gh0st is a remote access Trojan tool for windows. It can do the following:

	-take full control of the remote screen on the infected bot
	-provide real time as well as offline keystroke logging
	-provide live feed of webcam, microphone of infected host
	-take control of remote shutdown and reboot of host
	-disable infected computer remote pointer and keyboard input
	-enter into shell of remote infected host with full control
	-provide a list of all the active processes
	-clear all existing SSDT of all existing hooks

	The DLL is named SVCHOST.DLL. This is the server component of the gh0st toolkit and and checks in to the gh0st client application on startup. It is installed by the dropper program server.exe.

	A gh0st packet contains the following four fields:

	-a 5-byte header containing the characters Gh0st
	-a 4-byte integer that contains the size in bytes of the entire packet
	-a 4-byte integer that contains the size in bytes of the entire packet uncompressed
	-a variable-sized packet that contains the packet payload. The client sends small requests that contain commands, and the server responds to those commands with the requested data. 

	Detecting gh0st is trivial due to the 5-byte handshake, and a proper IDS (intrusion detection system) should be able to find a gh0st packet. Gh0st RATs are more complicated and harder to find nowadays. Some things to look for with include:

	Network Monitoring
		-outbound port 80 and 443 traffic to IP addresses and URLs in Eastern Europe
		-outbound port 80 traffic connecting to remote server without sending user-agent information
		-create IDS signatures to detect the unique data content at the end of the dropper application
		-create IDS signatures to detect embedded executable files

	Internal Port Scans
		Look for unexplained open TCP ports since gh0st needs to establish persistent connections. Routinely scan you internal network for suspicious open ports on systems/workstations.

	Monitor DNS Servers
		Logging DNS requests, since most modern malware uses dynamic DNS. One can configure their DNS server to log or alert on any request to dynamic DNS locations. Logging all DNS requests to Eastern Europe is also a good idea.

	Closely monitor end-node services
		Use of rootkits by attackers has increased recently, which is designed to run in Ring 0 (ring network) alongside the kernel as a device driver. Most malware still runs in Ring 3 (user node) since driver programming is more difficult and less people can do it. Because of this, most malware is running as a service and hiding in plain sight. 

	Closely monitor end-node event logs
		If you are monitoring services on end nodes, than you should also be monitoring Windows event logs. Turn on auditing and enable logging for both successful and fail logins. Pay close attention to security event entries 528 and 540 (successful logs). Of these, look for logon types 3 (SMB shares) and 10 (RDP), then identify the logon account. Intruders will try to connect to another machine with elevated privileged accounts via SMB admin shares or using remote desktop. Monitor event logs for this activity. 

Poison Ivy
	
	Poison Ivy is a RAT that is created and controlled by a Poison Ivy management program. The management program has a GUI. Once ran, the backdoor copies itself to either the Windows folder or the system32 folder. Filename and location are decided by the creator of the backdoor. The registry is altered to for persistence. Poison Ivy give a large amount of control over the infected computer including:

	-files can be renamed, deleted, executed
	-files can be uploaded and downloaded to and from the system
	-registry can be edited
	-currently run process can be viewed and killed
	-services can be viewed and controlled
	-installed devices can be viewed and some devices can be disabled
	-the list of applications can be viewed and entries can be deleted or programs uninstalled
	-remote command shell
	-screen capture or webcam
	-access saved passwords and password hashes

HTTP
	
	-HTTP: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
	-OSI Stack: Application Layer
	-Port: 80, 443 (HTTPS)

	Used for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. It is a generic, stateless protocol that can be used for tasks other than hypertext. This includes name servers and distributed object management systems, through extension of its request methods, error codes and headers. Typing and negotiation of data representation allows systems to be built independently of the data being transferred

	HTTP is a request/response protocol. The client sends a request to the server with a URI and protocol version, followed by a MIME-like message containing request modifiers, client information, and possible body content. The server responds with a status line including the message's protocol version, a success/error code, and another MIME-like message. This message contains server information, entity metainformation, and possible entity-body content.

SMTP

	-SMTP: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
	-OSI Stack: Application Layer
	-Port: 25, 587 (mail submission), 465 (SMTPS, legacy)

	SMTP is a protocol used in sending and receiving mail. SMTP is typically used for sending emails and POP3 and IMAP for receiving email.It doesn't have the ability to queue messages, which is the reason for POP3 and IMAP being used for users saving messages in a server mailbox.

DNS
	
	-DNS: Domain Name System
	-OSI Stack: Application Layer
	-Port: 53 (UDP)

	DNS is a naming system for computers, services, and any resources connected to a network. The DNS protocol is stateless and each packet has a header, question, answer, authority, and additional information field. 

	-Header: 12-byte header for destination information
	-Question: The question field is the only field in a query message. It contains Name, Type, and Class tuples (list object). For internet purposes, the name field is a fully-qualified domain name, the class is IN, and the type is a valid RR (resource records) type. The names can't be wildcarded but types and classes can be. Special types exist to wildcard mail record and to trigger zone transfers.
	-Answers: RRs that match the name, type, and class tuple of the question field. If any of the matching records are CNAME pointers (association to subdomain for another DNS lookup), then the target record is included in the answer. There can be multiple answers in the field since there can be multiple RRs with the same label.
	-Authority: Optional field that are RRs type NS records. NS records is used to delegate a subdomain to a set of name servers.
	-Additional: Records that the name server believes may be useful to the client. Most commonly used to supply address records for the name servers listed in the authority section.

SSL

	-SSL: Secure Socket Layer
	-OSI Stack: Application/Session Layer
	-Port: changes port of effected protocol (HTTPS 443)

	SSL and TLS are the most widely used security protocols. It provides a secure channel between two machines operating over the internet or a private network. HTTP over port 80 is susceptible to eavesdropping, but SSL ensures that the information is encrypted and secure. It is a session encrpytion wrapper for the HTTP protocol.

FTP

	-FTP: File Transfer Protocol
	-OSI Stack: Application Layer
	-Port: 21 (control), 20 (data), 22 (SFTP)

	FTP is a client to server protocol that relies on a command channel for controlling conversation and a sata channel for transmitting file content. Using FTP, a client can upload, download, rename, move, and copy files on a server. Login is required for an FTP server unless anonymous FTP is available. FTP sessions can be passive or active modes. In active mode, the server initiates a data connection back to the client and begins transferring data. In passive mode, the server uses a command channel to send the client information to open a data channel. HTTP no handles a lot of file transfering, but FTP is still used to transfer files behind the scenes.

SMB

	-SMB: Server Message Block 
	-OSI Stack: Application Layer
	-Port: 445 (on top of TCP port)

	SMB is a network file sharing protocol that allows applications to read and write to files and to request services from server programs in a computer network. The user of applications that use SMB can access files at a remote server as well as printers, mailslots, and named pipes. An open source version of SMB is called CIFS (common internet files system), and it provides more flexibility than existing internet applications like FTP. The Samba server is the most commonely used SMB/CIFS server.

Base64

	Base64 describes a type of encoding that encodes binary data by treating it numerically and making it a base64 representation. It is used to encode binary data that needs to be stored and transferred over media that are designed to deal with textual data. It most commonly uses A-Z, a-z, and 0-9 for the first 62 values. Different variations of base64 use different values for the last two.

URL Encoding
	
	URLs can only be sent using ASCII characters. If a URL containts characters outside the ASCII set, the URL must be converted to valid form. URL encoding replaces invalid ADCII characters with a "%" followed by two hexadecimal digits. For example, a URL encoding replaces spaces with a "+" sign or with "%20". 

	The%20quick%20brown%20fox

Quoted-Printable
	
	QP is encoding using printable ASCII characters to transmot 8-bit data over a 7-bit path, or any medium that cannot you 8-bit. It uses the "=" sign as an escape character. Line length is limited to 76 characters as well. Any 8-bit byte may be encoded with 3 characters, an "=" followed by two hexadecimal digits. All characters except printable ADCII characters or end of line characters must be encoded in this fashion. 

	If you believe that truth=3Dbeauty, then surely mathematics is the most bea=
	utiful branch of philosophy.

Unicode

	Unicode converts any unique character into a different number. It is the industry standard for encoding, representing, and handling text expressed in most of the world's writing systems. Unicode defines the code points (the number which represents a character), but the encoding determines how you store these points. 

Punycode

	Punycode is a way to represent Unicode with the limited characters of ASCII. The intended purpose is to encode international domain names so they can be present in the ASCII DNS on the internet. It removes the international symbols from the word, then adds a "-" with the corresponding code for the symbol at the end.

	München
	Mnchen-3ya

IDNs
	
	IDN stands for Internationalized Domain Name, and represents the domain names for any domain name that contains a language specific character. IDNs are encoded by computers using multi-byte Unicode and are stored in the DNS as ASCII using Punycode.

MIME - S/MIME

	MIME is an extension of the original email protocol that allows users to exchange different kinds of data files (audio, video, images, executables) along with the ASCII allowed in SMTP. Servers insert the MIME header at the beginning of a web transmission. Clients use this header to select the right application player for the type of data. 

Drive-by exploits & exploit kits

	Drive-by downloads describe an umbrella attack of visiting a website that is running malicious code. Most of the time these are compromised legit sites that redirect a victim to an attacker's site. These sites host exploit kits that probe browsers and other software of security vulnerabilities to attack. 

	Exploit kits are toolkits that automate the process of finding exploits for client-side vulnerabilities. It is a launching platform used to deliver other payloads, like malware. The exploit kit is ran on a malicious site and finds existing vulnerabilities in the system. From there it performs a drive-by download and downloads malicious software without the user knowing. Exploit kits in the present have easy to use UIs and make malicious activity and can even allow registered users to logon and view active victims and statistics. Owners of exploit kits will often encode the PHP scripts for proprietary reasons, with tools like ionCube.

DNS Amplification DDoS Attack

	An attack where a publically accessible DNS server is used to flood the targeted system with DNS traffic. The common technique involves sending a DNS name lookup request to the DNS server. The source address is spoofed to be the target's address.
