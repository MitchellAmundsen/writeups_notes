-crypto
	-caesar
	-rot13 - similar to caesar except using key 13
	-rot47
		-hard to recognize
		-detection
			-characters adcii in range 0x21 - 0x7f
			-lots of non-alphabetical characters
			-characters are all printable
	-substitution
		-detection
			-mostly alphabets
			-normally long ciphertext
		-solution
			-frequency analysis 
			-pattern recognition (quipquip)
	-vigenere
		-key: aplhabetical string of arbitrary length
		-first letter of key with first letter of plaintext
		-key repeats
	-playfair ciphet (not so common)
		-key: table of 5X5 alphabet or a keyword
		-useful site: rumkin
	-one-time pad
		-key: string of bytes same length as plaintext
		-encryption: XOR the key with message byte by byte
		-don't use it because if you transfer the key in a secure channel, we might as well transfer the plaintext in the same channel (same length)
	-multi-time pad
	-repeated key XOR
		-key: string of bytes of any length smaller than message size
		-encryption: repeat the key multiple times until it reaches the size of the message then XOR the key with the message byte by byte
		-detection: pattern repitition (if padded with null bytes or plaintext also has some kind of repition)
		-first compute hamming distance of different key length and choose minimum one and can solve with key length)
	-symmetric
		-encryption and decryption use the same key
		-stream cipher
			-symmetric key cipher where plaintext digits are combined with pseudorandom cipher digit stream
			-common stream ciphers
				-all ones covered previously
				-RC4 (really broken)
				-Salsa20
		-block cipher
			-common block ciphers
				-DES (broken, key space too small)
				-3DES(somewhat safe)
				-AES(safe)
				-blowfish(safe)
			-what is it
				-plain text is seperated into blocks of n-bits size
				-each block is encrypted with the specific algorithm
				-join the encyrpted blocks together to form ciphertext
			-padding used before encryption to make sure plaintext is multiple of block size
-encoding
	-base64: only contains 
		- A-z
		- 0-9
		- =\+
		- usually ends with one or more ==
	-base16(hex)
		- a-f
		- 0-9
		- sometimes starts with 0x
	-octal
		-only contains 0-7
		-starts with either o or 0
	-binary
		-only contains 0,1
		-sometimes starts with 0b
	-morse
		-only contains .,_
		-sometimes represented with 0 or 1
