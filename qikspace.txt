NoSQL
	- 'not only structured query language'
	- non-relational so no joins
	- has semi-structures fields and values stored, but doesn't require 
	- instead of rejecting data on entry relies on application to handle exceptions
	- more scalable
	- less functional
	- data structures
		- key-value
		- column/tabular
			- three elements 
				- unique name
				- value of the column
				- timestamp
			- json-like example
				{
				    street: {name: "street", value: "1234 x street", timestamp: 123456789},
				    city: {name: "city", value: "san francisco", timestamp: 123456789},
				    zip: {name: "zip", value: "94107", timestamp: 123456789},
				}
		- graph
		- document
			- assume documents encode data in some format
			- XML, JSON, YAML, BSON
			- organization
				- collections
				- tags
				- non-visible metadata
				- directory hierarchies
	- most lack true ACID transactions
		- atomicity (all or nothing)
		- consistency (one valid state to another, accuracy is held at beginning and end)
		- isolation (isolate what happens in transactions from what is being seen)
		- durability (once a transaction is commited it will remain so even in evenr of power loss creash or error)

Cassandra
	- hybrid key-value and tabular DBMS
	- scalability and availability
		- all nodes play identical role
		- no master node
		- no single point of failure
	- CQL (casandra query language) an SQL like language that helps the transisition form relational

LevelDB
	- key-value store
	- uses
		- used by a broswer to store a chache of recently accessed web pages
		- an OS to store a list of installed packages
		- application to store user preference settings
	- similar to SQLite

Realm
	- mobile database similar to SQLite
	- paired with realm mobile platform to automatically sync data

Filetagging
	- windows
		- add a tag to file
		- Tags: 'tag name'
		- media files
		- office 
	
UWP
	- helps develop application for windows 10 and windows 10 mobile 
	- supports C++, C#, VB.NET, XAML
	- extension of Windows runtme introduced in windows 8 and windows server 2012
