General
- default create one index per day
- a document is a single thing (syslog message)
- a shard is a collection of documents
- if a cluster has a replication factor of 2, one shard should exist one 2 nodes 
- shards will be mirrored upon a node dying to reach replication factor

Rolling Restart
- https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/_rolling_restarts.html
- idea is to disable reallocation, restart service and wait for it to join cluster, reenable shard allocation, repeat
- es api driven
    - ssh to es box
    - https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/cat.html
    - curl -s http://localhost:9200/_cat/
        - shows endpoints
    - curl -s http://localhost:9200/_cat/nodes
        - shows nodes in cluster 
        - m = masternode 
        - d = data node
        - md = master and data node
        - * = current elected master
    - curl -s http://localhost:9200/_cluster/settings | jq
        - cluster.allocation.enable = none means dont shuffle data if node added or rmd
        - exclude ips removes nodes from cluster
- cerebro = 3rd party web ui 
    - http://syslog-es1.uswest2.icebrg.io:8080/
    - http://localhost:9200
    - rest api tool
        - top left of cerebro
        - good for forumalating api requests
    - https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/allocation-filtering.html
        - excludes ip from cluster with that request
    - https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/_rolling_restarts.html
        - enables and disables reallocation
