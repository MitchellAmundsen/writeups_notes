	Data Warehouse
		- characteristics
			- subject oriented: designed to help analyze data
			- integrated: resolve problems such as inconsistency and name conflicts 
			- nonvolatile: data should not change once entered
			- time variant: need large amount of data, not archived after time
		- differences from OLTP (relational)
			- workload 
				- designed to accomodate ad hoc queries
				- OLTP systems support predefined operations in contrast
			- data modification
				- updated on regular basis in bulk
				- OLTP has end users routinely changing data
			- schema designe
				- denormalized or star schema to optimize performance
				- OLTP normalized for update/insert/delete and consistency
			- typical operations
				- scans thousands or millions of rows
				- OLTP usually access limited records
			- historical data
				- many months or years of data
				- OLTP only stores data usually from a short period after
			- has many indexes
			- has some joins
			- has denormalized dbms
			- common derived data and aggregates
		- architecture
			- basic
				- meta dat
		- types
			- data mart: simple form focuses on single object (such as sale or marketing)
			- OLAP
				- low volume of transactions
				- complex queries and aggregations
				- store aggregated historical data
			- OLTP
				- large number of transactions
				- short update insert delete transactions
		- benefit
			- integrate data from multiple sources into single DB
			- mitigate isolation level lock in contentious transaction
			- maintain data history
			- improve data quality with consistency between data


	TLDR: Data warehouses are relational databases that are designed for query and analysis instead of transactions and processing. Simple schema like the star schema are used for faster queries with less joins.

	PAE (Physical Address Extension)
		- sometimes referred to as page address extension
		- memory management system for 32-bit computer
		- page table hierachy 
			- table entries of 64 bits each
			- allow CPUs to access physical address space larger than 4GB
			- 4 GB the limit on 32-bit systems
		- used by most OSs

	LXLE Linux
		- ubuntu/lubuntu based
		- uses LXDE (lightweight x11 desktop environment)
		- lightweight distribution
		- focus on visuals
		- works well with older hardware in particular
		- released in 2013


	TLDR: Client wanted LXLE distribution of linux since her laptop was old and weak. She couldn't use a updated version since it required PAE and her laptop processor was actually that old. PAE allows 32-bit computers to use more memory addresses than available to them.

	Mamba Trojan
		- full disk encryption ransomware
		- mamba installs itself as windows service with name DefragmentationService
		- has LocalSystem privledges which is invisible and has almsot complete control
		- installs DiskCryptor in background
		- encryption takes tens of minutes to several hours
		- computer doesn't reboot automatically after encryption
		- plaintext password can be found in log_file.txt


	TLDR: Conficker is a Windows worm that uses bufferoverflow to get shell access and control over a computer. It has many variants and it's symptoms involve losing Windows services. Mamba trojan is a full disk encryptor ransomware that uses DiskCryptor to encrypt parts of the hard drive.

	Proxy
		- server that acts as intermediary for requests
		- proxy evaluates request to simplify and control i/o
		- types
			- proxy server: gateway or tunnel that passes unmodified requests and responses
			- forward proxy: internet facing proxy used to rretrieve from a wide range of sources, anonymizing the client that is requesting
			- reverse proxy: opposite of forward proxy and anonymizes servers

	Botnet
		- network of internet connected computers acting from a same C&C
		- used for DDoS and spam
		- components
			- C&C
			- Zombie computer: computer taken over by malware and used for malicious tasks while user is unaware

	Command and Control
		- servers and other infastructure used to control malware
		- botnets in particular, but can also control trojan etc
		- types
			- client-server model: individual client bots request services and resources from centralized C&C server
			- peer-to-peer: command and control embedded into botnet and commands sent to other bots with public key encryption
		- systems
			- domains
				- a specifically designed webpage or domains which lists command and controls
				- simple code and easily updated
				- easily siezed and stopped
			- IRC
				- simple in construction
				- low bandwidth communication methods 
			- P2P

	Fast Flux
		- constant changing network of compromised hosts acting as proxies
		- used by botnets to hide phishing and malware delivery sites
		- also refers to p2p, load balancing, and proxy redirection
		- numerous IP addresses associated with domain name and swapped at high frequency


	TLDR: Botnet is a number of compromised systems used to attack another system through DDoS or spam. They use a command and control server for direction, which may use websites, IRC, or peer-to-peer as a medium of communication. Fast flux is used by C&C to avoid getting the single controller shutdown. Fast flux uses a number of IP addresses associated with a single domain name, and rapidly swaps them out so there is no single point of failure. Proxy is a server that acts as an intermediary for requests, helping evaluate incoming requests and hiding identity of outgoing requests. 


December 12th 2016

	Fuzzing
		- automatic bug finding
		- fuzzer: program that injects automatically semi-random data into a prgram/stack

				- multiple bad files and opens sequentially
				- parser layer: file format constraints, structure, conventions, field sizes
				- codec/application later: lower level


	TLDR: Fuzzing is automatic testing of a program or system for bugs. It uses known problem numbers as well as RNG to test inputs for bufferoverflow or logic errors. 


December 14th 2016
	
	JTAG (Joing Test Action Group)
		- association formed for method on verifying designs and testing circuit boards
		- requires dedicated debug port on serial communications interface
		- interface connects to an on-chip test access port (TAP)
		- used for debugging and storing firmware


	TLDR: JTAG is a group that decides standards for testing, most well known for their role in debug ports


December 15th 2016

	Same-Origin Policy
		- web browser only allows scripts to access data found in second web page inly if second page if from same origin
		- similarity combination
			- same protocol
			- same host
			- same port
		- reason
			- malicious site could request data from site
			- site sees cookies of client's and returns client's data
			- malicious site has client's information


	TLDR: Same-origin policy gives restrictions on which alternatives pages an initial web page can acces, keeping malicious pages from using client's cookies to get their information.


December 16th 2016
	
	XSS
		- used to bypass same-origin policy
		- allows attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages
		- types
			- non-persistent
				- http query parameters used by server-side scripts to display results without sanitization
				- malicious code returned to client side as part of HTML response
				- ex: script tag put into input or search function and returned back to client 
				- requires social engineering for user to click on link with malicious code
				- results in cookie and data theft 
			- persistent
				- script provided by attacker saved by server and displayed by normal pages
				- ex: forum post of XSS HTML
				- no need for social engineering


	TLDR: XSS attacks come in to forms, with the goal of running malicious scripts on the client side to access stored browser information. Non-persistent requires malicious code to be input by the victim, where persistent XSS runs for all users on the compromised site.


December 17th 2016

	IRC (Internet Relay Chat)

			- execute exploit
		- payloads
			- 438 payloads
			- command shell
			- meterpreter: enables user to control screen of device using VNC
			- dynamic payloads: unique payloads to evade AV


	TLDR: IRC is a protcol for text based internet chat. Metasploit is a linux/windows pentesting application that creates exploit kits based on a chosen exploit and payload.


December 18th 2016

	Steganography
		- concealing a message/file within another message/file
		- commonly used in image or audio files
		- encrypts message with password
		- least significant bit insertion
		

	TLDR: Steganography is the art of concealing messages in image or audio files. The messages can be encrypted with a password and often use least significant bit insertion to store.

	Polymorphism
		- differences in classes that extend from each other
		- example
			- food class has certain attributes and methods
			- burger class can override those and make it's own
			- same with pasta class
			- number of classes that are all food but are different

	Abstract Method and Class
		- method
			- method declared without implementation
			- followed by semicolon
		- class
			- class that contains abstract methods
			- provides subclass with methods for implementation

	Method Overloading
		- two or more methods in one class have the same paramaters
		- compile time concept
		- ex: 142/3 assignments where constructor was different given parameters

	Method Overriding
		- two methods, one parent and one child method
		- overriding makes specific implementation of parent method
		- polymorphism applies to this
		- run-time concept

	Join Types
		- inner join
			- join based on record that match between tables
			- middle area in venn diagram
		- left join
			- select all record from 1st table along with matching records
			- first table plus middle table
		- right join
			- select all records from second table along with matching records
			- right table and middle
		- full
			- select all records


	TLDR: The following have to do with object oriented programming and inheritence. Polymorphism explains the differences in classes that extend from the same parent object. Abstract methods are methods that are declared, but do not have implementation, often used in a parent class to be implemented in child class. Method Overloading is having multiple methods in a class with the same name, but have different arguments and implementations. Method Overriding is when a child class will override a method in the parent class with it's own version/implementation. 

	Joins are categorized by the tables in which their data contains. Inner joins have common data, Left joins contain the first table and innter data, Right joins contain information from the second table and inner table, and full joins have data from all the tables.

			- /1 means every (minute/hour/day)
			- ex:
				- 01 * * * * root echo "This command is run at one min past every hour"
				- /1 * * * * root echo "This command is run every minute"


	TLDR: Cron is a program that allows a user to execute commands on a time/date basis. It is a daemon that uses the crontab to find date/time to run.

January 4th 2017

	Buffer Overflow
	- when a program attempts to store more data than it can hold in a buffer or past a buffer
	- buffer (in this case): sequential memory allocated to contain anything (integer, characters)
	- exploit
		- attacker sends data to undersized stack buffer
		- information on call stack is overwritten, including return pointer
		- return of funaction transfers control to malicious code contained in attacker original data
	- cause
		- bound checking 
		- memory manipulation functions (C and C++ usually)
	- typical occurs in code that
		- relies on external data to control its behavior
		- depends on properties of the data that are enforced outside immediate scope
		- too complex for programmer to predict behavior
	- web applications
		- can be present in web servers or application server products
		- vulnerabilities in server products can be known and used in multiple uses
		- can be found in custom code as well
	- consequences
		- availability: generally lead to crashes or infinite loops
		- access control: execute arbitrary code
		- other: arbitrary code can do anything theoretically
	- interpreted languages are safe (java, python)
	- C, C++, Fortan, Assembly usually platforms

January 19th 2017

	DNS cont
		- query (broswer, system, recursive, root, name)
			- query starts off with broswer cache
			- then moves to system resolver that checks static system files
			- passed to recursive DNS server 
				- checks cache
				- checks if it has address of name servers
				- send query to most specific domain component (example.com or .com server)
			- goes to root server if it has no leads
				- root server knows address of all name/authoritative servers
				- sends recursive server referral to name server (.com server)
		- types of DNS servers
			- authoritative
				- only concerns itself with answering queries for zone it's responsible for
				- responds quickly to queries in its zone
				- never acts as client (unlike recursive)
				- no cache since it never queries
			- caching/recursive
				- acts as client
				- access to entire range of public DNS
				- handles DNS resolution
				- responds to client with DNS query answer or error
				- maintains cache
			- forwarding
				- acts as intermediary between client and recursive
				- sends the recursive request
				- holds local cache at closer network location
				- can ensure internal requests are server by private servers

			- send and receive data simultaneously
			- capture everything on wire
			- pro
				- eliminates risk of dropping packets
				- monitoring device receives all packets including physical errors
				- provides full visibility
			- cons
				- analysis device may need dual-receive capture interface
				- cannot monitor intra-switch traffic
		- SPAN (switch port analyzer)
			- hardware and media errors dropped
			- RX (receive) and TX (transmit) copied in on TX signal
			- if use exceeds link compacity packets are dropped
			- pro
				- low cost
				- captures intra-switch traffic
				- remotely configurable
			- cons
				- cannot handle heavily utilized links without dropping packets
				- filters out physical layer errors
				- can change timing of frame interaction
				- prioritizes SPAN port data lower than regular port-to-port
