	Data Warehouse
		- characteristics
			- subject oriented: designed to help analyze data
			- integrated: resolve problems such as inconsistency and name conflicts 
			- nonvolatile: data should not change once entered
			- time variant: need large amount of data, not archived after time
		- differences from OLTP (relational)
			- workload 
				- designed to accomodate ad hoc queries
				- OLTP systems support predefined operations in contrast
			- data modification
				- updated on regular basis in bulk
				- OLTP has end users routinely changing data
			- schema designe
				- denormalized or star schema to optimize performance
				- OLTP normalized for update/insert/delete and consistency
			- typical operations
				- scans thousands or millions of rows
				- OLTP usually access limited records
			- historical data
				- many months or years of data
				- OLTP only stores data usually from a short period after
			- has many indexes
			- has some joins
			- has denormalized dbms
			- common derived data and aggregates
		- architecture
			- basic
				- meta dat
		- types
			- data mart: simple form focuses on single object (such as sale or marketing)
			- OLAP
				- low volume of transactions
				- complex queries and aggregations
				- store aggregated historical data
			- OLTP
				- large number of transactions
				- short update insert delete transactions
		- benefit
			- integrate data from multiple sources into single DB
			- mitigate isolation level lock in contentious transaction
			- maintain data history
			- improve data quality with consistency between data

	TLDR: Data warehouses are relational databases that are designed for query and analysis instead of transactions and processing. Simple schema like the star schema are used for faster queries with less joins.

	PAE (Physical Address Extension)
		- sometimes referred to as page address extension
		- memory management system for 32-bit computer
		- page table hierachy 
			- table entries of 64 bits each
			- allow CPUs to access physical address space larger than 4GB
			- 4 GB the limit on 32-bit systems
		- used by most OSs

	LXLE Linux
		- ubuntu/lubuntu based
		- uses LXDE (lightweight x11 desktop environment)
		- lightweight distribution
		- focus on visuals
		- works well with older hardware in particular
		- released in 2013

	TLDR: Client wanted LXLE distribution of linux since her laptop was old and weak. She couldn't use a updated version since it required PAE and her laptop processor was actually that old. PAE allows 32-bit computers to use more memory addresses than available to them.

	Conficker
		- windows OS worm
		- 5 variants of conficker A B C D E
		- infection
			- infected computer uses buffer overflow to execute shell code
			- uses shell to connect to source over HTTP
			- downloads DLL virus and attaches to svchost.exe, services.exe, or windows explorer.exe
			- registry key added for persistance
		- symptoms
			- account lockout policies reset automatically
			- certain windows services disabled
			- domain controllers respond slowly to client requests
			- congestion on LAN
			- AV websites or windows update become inaccessible
			- user accounts locked out

	Mamba Trojan
		- full disk encryption ransomware
		- mamba installs itself as windows service with name DefragmentationService
		- has LocalSystem privledges which is invisible and has almsot complete control
		- installs DiskCryptor in background
		- encryption takes tens of minutes to several hours
		- computer doesn't reboot automatically after encryption
		- plaintext password can be found in log_file.txt

	Proxy
		- server that acts as intermediary for requests
		- proxy evaluates request to simplify and control i/o
		- types
			- proxy server: gateway or tunnel that passes unmodified requests and responses
			- forward proxy: internet facing proxy used to rretrieve from a wide range of sources, anonymizing the client that is requesting
			- reverse proxy: opposite of forward proxy and anonymizes servers

	Botnet
		- network of internet connected computers acting from a same C&C
		- used for DDoS and spam
		- components
			- C&C
			- Zombie computer: computer taken over by malware and used for malicious tasks while user is unaware

	Command and Control
		- servers and other infastructure used to control malware
		- botnets in particular, but can also control trojan etc
		- types
			- client-server model: individual client bots request services and resources from centralized C&C server
			- peer-to-peer: command and control embedded into botnet and commands sent to other bots with public key encryption
		- systems
			- domains
				- a specifically designed webpage or domains which lists command and controls
				- simple code and easily updated
				- easily siezed and stopped
			- IRC
				- simple in construction
				- low bandwidth communication methods 
			- P2P

	Fast Flux
		- constant changing network of compromised hosts acting as proxies
		- used by botnets to hide phishing and malware delivery sites
		- also refers to p2p, load balancing, and proxy redirection
		- numerous IP addresses associated with domain name and swapped at high frequency

December 12th 2016

	Fuzzing
		- automatic bug finding
		- fuzzer: program that injects automatically semi-random data into a prgram/stack
		- use random data or static fuzzing vectors (known dangerous values)
		- types of fuzzing
			- application fuzzing
				- UI testing
				- command line options
				- import/export
			- protocol fuzzing
				- acts a proxy and modifies requests
				- sends forged packets
			- file format fuzzing
				- multiple bad files and opens sequentially
				- parser layer: file format constraints, structure, conventions, field sizes
				- codec/application later: lower level
