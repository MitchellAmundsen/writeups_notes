categorization
	peer-to-peer network
		- both provide and consume information
		- easy to implement (windows has peer to peer services)
		- problems
			- not very scalable
			- lack centralized control
			- no centralized place to store information

	client-server network
		- server provides network resources
		- client consumes network services
		- server operating systems
			- linux
			- windows server
			- red hat
			- vmware
		- benefits
			- highly scalable
			- easier to support with centralized services

	local area network LAN
		- networking geographically (close by)

	wide area network WAN
		- connected via internet 
		- far away geographically

	baseband
		- one signal across network medium
		- only one at a time takes whole traffic

	broadband
		- divides the medium into multiple channels

OSI and TCP/IP models
	- physical layer: cables and bits
		- physical/electrical stage
		- conversion between signals
		- voltages, cable specifications, NIC, pinouts
	- data link layer: sending MAC address, sending to switch, sending frames
		- point to point
		- sending to specific MAC address
		- hub (layer 2 device that repeats packets to all devices)
		- bits to frames
	- network layer: sending to IP addresses, router, packets
		- translate logical address (IP) to physical (MAC)
		- transferring data from through networks
		- routers assign hardware an IP adress
		- routers have ip adresses 
		- router takes packets and routes it to other router
	- transport layer: provides management, session into packets
		- tcp or udp
			- tcp receipt
			- udp no tracking (doesnt care if you got it)
		- manages and controls packets
		- udp faster since no verification between packages
		- negotiated based on protocol
	- session layer: communication and management (dictating who's allowed to talk and when)
		- establishes, manages, and terminates connections
		- handshakes, verification
	- presentation layer: encrypting and decrypting, formatting
		- formats packages for application layer
		- facilitates different formats for different computers
		- encryption/decryption
	- application layer: allows programs to connect to network
		- protocols (ex: smtp, http, ftp)
		- formats it for human use
		- indentifies communication partners
		- syncs communication
		- determines resources available

	- tcp/ip model
		- network interface: combination of physical and datalink layer
		- internet layer: network layer
		- transport layer: transport layer
		- application layer: session + presentation + application layer

Devices and Protocols in relation to OSI
	- MAC address
		- media access control address
		- layer 2 data link
		- physical address
	- IP address
		- layer 3 network layer
		- logical address matched to physical address
	- EUI 64
		- layer 2 data link
		- ipv6 global unicast
		- specific to network around the world
		- data link since it is specific to physical device
	- frames
		- layer 2 protocol delivery unit
		- segment of data 
	- packet
		- layer 3 protocol delivery unit
		- segment of data
	- switch
		- layer 2
		- map to MAC addresses
	- router
		- layer 3 
		- moves data across networks
		- maps ip addresses to mac addresses
	- hub
		- layer 2
		- passes information to everyone
		- "dumb" switch
	- encryption device
		- layer 6 presentation
		- format data
		- device on the wire that encrypts and decrypts
	- cable/NIC
		- layer 1 physical
	- bridge
		- layer 2
		- point to point connectivity
