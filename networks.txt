		- max number in octet is 255
		- 256 total values since 0 is valid (256 is not)
		- binary
			- 128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
			- 1 adds the value 0 does not
			- 11111111 = 255
	- classes
		- describes how many hosts can be on ip
		- class a
			- 1.0.0.0 - 126.0.0.0
			- subnet mask 255.0.0.0
			- first octet is network id
			- very few class a addresses
			- millions of hosts can be on network
			- useful for ISPs
		- class b
			- 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.0.0
			- first and second octet is network
			- subnet mask 255.255.0.0
		- class c
			- 192.0.0.0 - 223.255.255.0
			- first three octets network id
			- subnet mask 255.255.255.0
		- class d
			- for multicasting (sending values to multiple computers)
			- 224.0.0.0 - 239.0.0.0
	- subnet mask
		- anything on a ip address for corresponding bit is part of network id
		- ex: 255.0.0.0 subnet mask
		- all values in first octet are part of network id
	- public vs private
		- every device in a network gets a private ip
		- routers given public ip addresses
		- can use different private networks within one network to separate devices
			- 192.168.0.1 and 192.168.1.1
		- private classes
			- class a
				- 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
				- subnet mask 255.0.0.0
				- default addressing subnet mask 255.0.0.0
			- class b

				- subnet mask - 255.240.0.0
				- default addressing subnet mask - 255.255.0.0
				- difference between two subnet masks allows us 15 (255-240) network 
			- class c 
				- 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255
				- subnet mask - 255.255.0.0

APIPA Automatic Private IP Addressing
	- 169.254.x.x
	- when DHCP is unavailable

CIDR Classless Inter-Domain Routing
	- variable length subnet masks
	- /16 vs. 255.255.0.0
	- /N is the number of continuous bits that are 1 from left to right
	- /12 = 255.240.0.0

IPV4 vs. IPV6
	- ipv4
		- 32 bits into 4 octets
		- 4 billion ip addresses
	- ipv6
		- 128 bit 
		- in hexadecimal format
			- each character is composed of 4 bits
			- A - F = 10 - 15
		- consec 0's = ::
			- can only work once
			- use on most consecutive 0's in address
		- omit leading 0 in hex set

MAC Addresses
	- each NIC has it's own MAC address
		- laptop will have two if it has wired and wireless connection
		- dongle will have own MAC as well
	- format
		- in hexidecimal format
		- 6 sections of 2 hex characters
		- 48 bit address
	- used in 
		- DNS
		- ARP
		- DHCP
			- new device on network sends DHCP discover request
			- asks for anybody that does DHCP
			- DHCP device sends our IP address for new device and waits for response
			- once confirmation response, gives new device IP
			- uses MAC address for communicatin during that process
	- data link layer 2

Subnetting
	- additional networks to a/b/c
	- have beginning/end that you cant use
	- first - network ID (even)
	- last - broadcast (odd)
	- ip address with subnet mask
		- N = furthest left number not 255
		- 256 - N = network increment
		- first usable = netid + 1 increment
		- last usable = next netid - 2
		- ex:
			- ip: 192.168.1.37
			- sm: 255.255.255.240
			- N - 240
			- net inc = 256 - 240 = 16
			- net ID = 32
			- broadcast = 32 + 16 -1 = 47
			- usable addresses = 33 - 46


Router/Switches/Hubs etc.
	- hub
		- sends packets to every node connected
		- computer decides to accept or reject
	- switch
		- tracks MAC addresses and ports connected
		- sends packets to node directed to
	- multi-layer switch
		- routing and switching
		- layer 2 and 3
	- bridge
		- connect network segments
		- passes data to other bridge
		- layer 2
		- wireless bridges can connect single network
	- repeater
		- take signal and amplify them (power)
		- can also clean signal


Router
	- move data across different networks
	- segment / subnetting of network
	- manage traffic flow
	- manage tables
		- where to send data
		- internal MAC to IP
	- default gateway
		- router only sends packets directed to it
		- computer has default gateway router that it sends to if unknown destination
	- routing tables
		- where to pass data
		- information needed (protocol based)
			- destination network IP/SM
			- steps to get there (router path)
			- number of hops to other routers
		- cmd: route print to view computer routing table
		- protocols determine fastest path
	- metrics (qualities for best path)
		- hop count: how many routers from A to B
			- cmd > tracert 8.8.8.8
		- maximum transmission unit: largest packet size/bandwidth
		- cost
			- reliability, roundtrip time, etc
			- low # = good
			- high # = bad
		- latency: delay on this link
		- protocols
			- link state
				- $$ cost based
				- multiple factors (distance, speed, etc)
				- OSPF
			- distance vector
				- # of hops
				- RIP & RIPv2
			- hybrid
				- both
				- distance vector and link state
	- IGP vs EGP
		- Interior Gateway Protocol
			- protocols that work inside single managed network
			- communicating multiple internal routers together
			- RIP
				- routing information protocol
				- distance vector (hop count)
				- max 15 hops
				- only handles standard classful subnets (a, b, c, d)
			- RIPv2
				- more hops
				- support for classless addresses
			- OSPF
				- open shortest path first
				- most used IGP
				- link state analysis (cost based)
				- supports classless
			- IGRP
				- cisco distance vector
				- more hops than RIP/no classless addresses
			- EIGRP
				- enhanced IGRP
				- cisco hybrid
				- supports classless
		- Exterior Gateway Protocol
			- communicated external routers
			- uses BGP (border control protocol)
				- path-vector protocol
				- one speaker node in each domain
				- transmits routing tables
	- Dynamic Routing Tables
		- automatically finds the 'best' route
		- convergence 
			- all routers have same topology and routing information
			- occurs at different rates
				- network size
				- types of routing protocols
				- hardware/device problems
	- Spanning Tree Protocol
		- loops in network infastructure will cause problems with broadcasts
		- blocks certain links to prevent loops
		- most direct path not always available
		- if devices go offline, blocks may be removed

Broadcast vs. Collision Domain
	- broadcast comain
		- devices that can be reached at layer 2
		- not through router
	- collision domains
		- two or more devices that if multiple talk there is collision
		- links between devices
		- hubs create collision domains (hubs dumb and talk while other device may send data)
		- switches, routers, bridges stop collisions

VLAN
	- virtual local area network
	- segment large network
		- broadcasts go to the same vlan
		- access port: connect devices in vlan to switch
		- trunk port: connect different switches from different vlans together
			- allow traffic from all vlans
			- tags packets (frames?) with vlan information
	- vlan filter criteria
		- physical port (manual)
		- mac addresses
		- subnetting IP addresses

Port Mirroring (SPAN ports)
	- SPAN: switch port analyzers
	- switches only send packets to port addressed to, bad for diagnostics or other reasons
	- SPAN can configure port to have all data mirrored to it
		- capture network data
		- diagnostic/research/IDS
		- devices can't talk on SPAN port
			- workaround is to have two NICs and connect to different port
		- can have all ports mirrored to one port
		- may drop packets if too much data sent (only on SPAN port)

TCP/IP Suite
	- TCP: transmission control protocol
		- verified delivery to endpoint

TCP Protocol
	- transmission control protocol
	- larger header (20 bytes)
		- addressing information
		- which order the packet is in (numbered)
		- retransmission
	- large packets size due to header
	- 1 to 1 connection oriented
	- three way handshake
		- SYN: initiate connection, synchronize, sent from initiator
		- SYN/ACK: receiver acknowledges SYN
		- ACK: initiator ackowledges successful connection
	- data sent as stream, cut up as max packet size based on connection/network
	- checksums to ensure packet is not corrupted

UDP Protocol
	- user datagram protocol
	- connectionless
	- no error recovery, no check on packet corruption
	- distinct chunks
		- unlike tcp where packets are max size
		- udp packet must make sense with next level protocol
		- logical chunks prepares for chance of next packet not being received

Internet Control Message (don't user port)
	- ICMP (layer 3)
		- internet control message protocol
		- deliver error/query
		- determine if service is available
		- echo request to see if online (ping)

	- ARP (layer 2.5)
		- IP to MAC
		- manage tables
		- ARP request enumerate network
		- who is x tell x mitm
			- malicious device uses arp request to determine all computers default gateway in network
			- next time computer asks for the default gateway, computer responds pretending to be that router
			- can mitm and view traffic
