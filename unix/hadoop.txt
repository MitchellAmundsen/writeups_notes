Overview
  - stores things at block level (data)
  - map reduce (jobs)
  - multi-cluster

Pieces
  - filesystem
    - namenode
      - master
      - tracks block allocation in memory
      - manages block replication (a,b)(b,c)(c,a)
      - only needs to live on two for redundancy
    - dfs nodes
      - workers
    - zookeeper	
      - manages name nodes
      - ensures consistency across nodes
      - lives on namenodes
    - hadoop zkfs
      - keeps track of leader election
      - talks to zookeeper on behalf of namenode
    - resource manager
      - manages compute resources
      - applies map reduce to run jobs where data lives locally
      - only needs to live on two for redundancy
    - journal
      - runs on master 1 and 2 like namenodes
      - namenode tells journal intent to write
      - journal tells zookeeper of this intent

commands/files
  - master
    - /etc/hadoop/conf/slaves
      - lists workers address
    - /etc/hadoop/conf/exclude
      - list of workers to be decommed and data moved to slaves
    - /etc/facter/facts.d/hadoop.yaml
    - hiera
      - controls componenets (hadoop, zookeeper, hbase)
    - hdfs dfs -ls <dir name>
      - shows all files
      - empty name list available dir
    - hdfs dfs
      - shows available commands
