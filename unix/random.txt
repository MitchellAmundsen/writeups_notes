Load
    - a count of the number of processes using or waiting for the CPU at a single point in time
    - if load avg is less than one, every processes that needed cpu could use it immediately without being blocked
    - if load avg is greater than one, processes are being blocked
    - if you have 4 cpu cores, then the load must be greater than 4 to mean blockage

Watch
    - watch -n 10 -d cat /sys/class/net/wlp58s0/statistics/rx_packets
        - every ten seconds print sys file and shows diff
        - good for watching frequency of updating of file
